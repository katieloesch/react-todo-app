## <a name="description"></a> 1. Description

A todo list application built from scratch using React.js with full CRUD functionality: users can add new tasks to the list, mark tasks as completed, edit tasks and remove tasks from the list.
The application also displays the total number of tasks remaining and tasks are saved in the browser's local storage, so they persist after reloading the page. There is also filtering functionality to show completed tasks only, incomplete tasks or all tasks.
Application state is managed with Redux and styling was achieved using CSS modules with a fully responsive design.

### MVP

- Create a to-do list application using React.js with:
  - Ability to add new tasks to the list
  - Ability to mark tasks as completed
  - Ability to remove tasks from the list
  - Display the total number of tasks remaining
- Store tasks in the browser's local storage, so that they persist after the page is reloaded
- Use Create React App to set up the project
- Use functional components and hooks (e.g. useState, useEffect)
- Use CSS modules or styled components for styling
- The user interface should be responsive and intuitive.
- Use a state management library such as Redux or Context API to manage the application state
- Use Git for version control and commit frequently with clear commit messages
- Write clear and concise code, and comment where necessary
- Host the application on a public Git repository and provide the link to the repository

### Stretch Goals

- Add drag and drop functionality for tasks
- Allow tasks to be edited after they have been added
- Add filtering functionality to show completed tasks only or all tasks
- Add search functionality to search for tasks by name
