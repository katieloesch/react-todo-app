## Deliverables

### MVP

- Create a to-do list application using React.js with:
  - Ability to add new tasks to the list
  - Ability to mark tasks as completed
  - Ability to remove tasks from the list
  - Display the total number of tasks remaining
- Store tasks in the browser's local storage, so that they persist after the page is reloaded
- Use Create React App to set up the project
- Use functional components and hooks (e.g. useState, useEffect)
- Use CSS modules or styled components for styling
- The user interface should be responsive and intuitive.
- Use a state management library such as Redux or Context API to manage the application state
- Use Git for version control and commit frequently with clear commit messages
- Write clear and concise code, and comment where necessary
- Host the application on a public Git repository and provide the link to the repository

### Stretch Goals

- Add drag and drop functionality for tasks
- Allow tasks to be edited after they have been added
- Add filtering functionality to show completed tasks only or all tasks
- Add search functionality to search for tasks by name
